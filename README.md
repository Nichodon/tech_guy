Hi! This is a game I'm probably not going to finish.

It's about suspension and everything else is uncertain! What fun!

### Development

You might want to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed and run

```sh
npm install
```

To run ESLint, do

```sh
npm run lint
```

You can make ESLint try to fix a file by doing

```sh
npx eslint path/to/file.js --fix
```
